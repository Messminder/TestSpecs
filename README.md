# TestSpecs
TestSpecs is a terminal system information and specification fetching program written in Python using textual and rich python modules. It is not something to be used seriously for practical usage. The sole purpose of TestSpecs is to practice programming. The reason why this repo is public is for portfolio reasons only.
Please move along.
